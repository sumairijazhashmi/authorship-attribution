Years of hard work and diplomacy have protected Ireland from all of that. Thank you to our friends in Europe and our spectacular civil servants in Dublin and Brussels
"4 years ago when UK voted to leave, we feared No deal could cause hard border in Ireland, end the Common Travel Area with GB, threaten Good Friday Agreement, our position in EU single market, disrupt aviation &amp; haulage, &amp; impose quotas &amp; tariffs on farmers, businesses &amp; exporters"
Level playing field secured. UK will have to match EU standards to maintain access to full EU market. Hopefully deal can be ratified by European Parliament by NY. But Brexit will never be ‘done’. Will be need for future agreements &amp; disputes will arise that have to be resolved
"It will come as a relief to our farmers, industry and exporters. No tariffs and no quotas. For aviation &amp; energy it is close to the status quo and for transport/haulage there are special arrangements around cabotage."
We have best #Brexit deal possible after 4 years of tough protracted negotiations. Deal builds on Irish Protocol negotiated in The Wirral which guarantees the common travel area and no hard border in Ireland. A sad but mementous day. Thank you @MichelBarnier and @vonderleyen

These new powers will be transposed into Irish law from an EU directive. Really positive development for consumers.
"Government agreed today to give @CCPCIreland &amp; @comreg more powers to enforce Competition Law. Will give them more teeth to protect consumers &amp; crack down on anti-competitive practices. Cartels, where they exist, will be broken up. Abuse of dominance will not be tolerated."
"For the first time in 21 years, my sister and family won’t be home for Christmas. Like thousands of others, our family will be incomplete this year. I know it’s really unfair but it is for the best. Have to stay safe. We will make up for it next year and 2021 will be a great year"
Honoured to visit St Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown this am. Thank you to the staff for fabulous job done so well in the year of the pandemic. Nollaig Shona Dhíobh https://t.co/ngQdhvEKlr
"Christmas is here but the work goes on through the break, starting with plans for the Right to Disconnect from work. 

You can give your feedback on our new strategy at https://t.co/TqwRMp6uKz https://t.co/IvOpTlPOlp"
"Good meeting of #NSMC today on #Covid #Brexit and important cross border projects like the A5, Ulster Canal and Narrow Water Bridge https://t.co/hxCfeaQuaJ"
"This Code will be more than just guidance, it will be admissible in evidence in proceedings before a court, the Labour Court or a WRC Adjudication Officer"
I asked the WRC to design a Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect. There’s an opportunity to have your say – more info here: https://t.co/8AWlrv3JHb
"We want remote working to become a bigger part of life after Covid. If done right, benefits will be huge. However, there are downsides &amp; we need to make sure people can switch off"
I’ll be on @RTE_PrimeTime shortly talking to @MiriamOCal about #christmas #Covid and #Brexit
"Congratulations to Ballinrobe Business Organisation, Mayo County Council and all those involved in putting this together

"Launched latest @BalanceInBizIE report today. Shows solid progress but still lot more to do. I initiated @BalanceInBizIE in 2018 to get more women on boards &amp; leadership teams. By excluding women, companies are ignoring the talent of half of the population &amp; that’s bad business https://t.co/zAKGqub1to"
Thrilled to announce €3m for Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park for these tough Covid times. https://t.co/llG8S1Y1pY
"Signed this evening. Provides for better energy efficiency in products and labelling - motors, kitchen appliances, lights etc https://t.co/MBJAaYdfGP"
"Some initial findings from Central Bank today, which suggest most insurers apply some form of differential pricing. This discriminates against existing &amp; loyal customers.  Will wait full report &amp; recs in 2021 on how best to deal with this practice - https://t.co/t6QMEaWVzG"

This week’s update is on Brexit.  Information for businesses and workers👇 #PrepareforBrexit https://t.co/8FuX2edDa5
"Really devastating news for workers in Viatris’ Baldoyle facility today. Government on hand to help those affected – job opportunities, retraining, education, income support.  Company has assured us the 1,400 other jobs in Galway, Dublin and Cork are secure."
We fought too hard to secure Peace on our island to risk falling backwards. We must stand up to those who would glorify violence again
"I don’t doubt he believes this. But every time a SF TD glorifies violence it makes a united Ireland harder to achieve. Killing kids, bombing pubs &amp; shops was never justified. Not in our name. We need a statement from Mary Lou McDonald on whether she agrees https://t.co/6kUB5pUO36"
Boost for Meath. MSD are building a new manufacturing facility in Dunboyne and will hire 240 over the next few years (100 of which will be hired over the next year). Great news. Best of luck to MSD with the project.
I know cost of insurance is a big problem. Government published a plan today to bring costs down. Here are the main points👇 https://t.co/gUFE9g4KoS
"One of Roscommon’s biggest employers, Harmac Medical Products are expanding, hiring 60 new staff. Company increasing mask &amp; ventilator production in response to pandemic. Great news for the county."
Good news today from @Flipdish.  300 new hires over 2 years. Great example of an Irish company adapting quickly to the changes brought about by Covid. They have enabled thousands of businesses in the hard-hit hospitality sector to pivot online
"I have made no public comment on the Brian Stanley tweets but listening to Mary Lou McDonald this morning equivocating &amp; justifying glorification of violence, latent homophobia &amp; internal party intimidation is truly nauseating. This is not the kind of change Ireland needs, ever."
Thank you especially to our young people. I know you have missed out on a lot this year. 2021 will be a better year #antiviral https://t.co/TosjZjiw8k

Latest ECDC traffic light map for travel. Ireland stays amber. Dublin and Reyjavik are the only capital cities that are not red zones.
All businesses reopening this week will receive a bonus week of the CRSS payment to help you get back on your feet. Thank you for all the sacrifices you have made to keep us safe.
"Government is here to help businesses reopening this week. EWSS will be available until end of Jan next year, CRSS payment bonus, VAT rate reduction, low cost loan extension, PUP still available"
"IQVIA, a company that works on drug safety, is hiring 170 new roles to prepare for a potential Covid vaccine. Still some way to go, but some really positive indications recently. These jobs will be remote so can be from anywhere in the country"

Sharing this again on today #WorldAIDSday. It’s so important to #KnowYourStatus and reduce stigma around getting tested.
"Thousands of shops, gyms, hotels, hairdressers and cinemas re-open today. Good luck to you all. Stay safe."
"Best of luck to all going back to work today. There are nearly 150,000 returning this week. It’s been a really tough few weeks. Thank you for all your patience"

I know businesses have more than enough to deal with at the moment. There is help available. A good first step is to fill out the Brexit Readiness Checker to see what exactly needs to be done https://t.co/41qEYnazH2
